# SalaryPredictionPortfolio
Salary Prediction Project (Python)

**GOAL** : Predict salary based on Job Description

**INTRODUCTION:** In this project, I am going to build predictive model for accurately predicting salaries based on three datasets.

**Train features and Train salaries-** This predictive model is trained using these 2 datasets consisting of 10 variables(including the target varibale) and 1 millon entries. <br />
**Test features-**  This dataset is used for predicting the model which is built. <br />

The tools I  used are Python and the libraries- numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn.

#**DEFINING THE PROBLEM **

**Can we predict salary based on Job Description?**

Why it is important to predict salary ? Well, the purpose is multifaceted.

Predicting salary based on Job location, skillset, experience and other factors serves both employers and employee purpose. Both can have financial gain ! How ?

How this is useful to employees? <br />

**Objectives**  <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; -Help employees take right decision in chosing a particular job.

&nbsp; &nbsp; -Help employers chose the correct candidates and pay.
